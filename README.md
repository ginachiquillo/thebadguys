Here is the updated README. I’ve refined the **User Personas** to reflect the current state of the app (Job Seeker focus) and the **Meet the Dev** section to highlight your role as the Admin/Creator.

# 🕵️‍♀️ The Bad Guys — LinkedIn Fake Profile Detection

> **"Because your career journey is too important to waste on scammers, sweetheart."**

## 🌸 Why I Built This
I am a power user of LinkedIn—constantly hiring talent and looking for my next big opportunity. I got tired of the noise. The fake recruiters, the "too-good-to-be-true" job offers, and the phishing attempts. 

I built **The Bad Guys** for myself to reclaim my time. I realized that if I needed a way to filter the "bad guys" from the real opportunities, so did everyone else. This is a tool built by a user, for users.

## 👩‍💻 Meet the Dev & Admin
That’s me. I am the creator and the primary "investigator" behind the platform. I built this app because I believe the professional world should be built on trust. I don't just maintain the code; I manage the "Wall of Shame" and the data quality to ensure that when you search a profile, you’re getting the truth.

## 👥 User Personas

### 1. The Job Seeker (Current Focus)
* **The Profile:** Active on LinkedIn, applying for roles, and receiving high volumes of outreach.
* **The Pain Point:** Afraid of falling for a scam or wasting 30 minutes on a conversation with a bot.
* **The Need:** A "second opinion" that feels like a protective friend. They want to know "Is this safe?" so they can focus on real growth.

### 2. The Admin (Me)
* **The Profile:** The gatekeeper of the platform.
* **The Pain Point:** Needs to manage malicious data and patterns efficiently.
* **The Need:** Tools to add malicious profiles, manage API credentials, and use AI to detect patterns across the database to keep the platform clean for everyone.

*Note: Future updates will include specialized tools for the **The Recruiter** persona to verify candidate authenticity.*
